> adding exits needs twice the work: you need to add the exit to one room to the other
and same backwards. Could we add a simple link between two rooms? Links can be two-sided
or one-sided
    - maybe a link method would be handy

ex. code
create room1
create room2
room1.link(room2, direction, two_sided = True)
